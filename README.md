# Short-term load forecasting

Load forecasting is a technique used by power companies to predict the power or energy needed to balance the supply and load demand at all the times. It is mandatory for proper functioning of electrical industry.

## Scope:

### Forecast 24hr horizon electrical load at 15-min intervals.

Overview:

### 1) Data Preprocessing

-   Filled in missing values for temperature:

        Time-aware linear interpolation

-   Fixed erroneous load data:

        Replaced zero values with day-of-week / month mean for specific interval.

-   Dataset partitioning:

        Divided data in a) training-validation and, b) test set

### 2) Model Formulation

-   EDA:

        Explored relationship of time - temperature - load

-   Model Selection:

        Random Forest -- Perform good with non-linear data, easy tuning (given time constraint) and implementation, scalable for this application.

        Working hypothesis about the model: Multiple independent models perform better than an aggregate since long-term exposure would introduce trend bias.

-   Feature creation:

        Temporal features (ie. previous day interval, morning / afternoon peak, min / max temperature)

### 3) Model tuning

-   Built methodology to cross-validate

        See notebooks/02 for details.

### 4) Test model

-   Evaluation class

        Takes forecaster class and test set as parameter for out-of-sample validation.

        Used Mean Absolute Percentage Error

-   Sample out-of-sample prediction: MAPE = 1.8 %

### 5) Ongoing thoughts

-   Still high variance, cross-validate features, tree parameters, increase robustness of special days.

-   Temperature should be estimated through 2 variable interpolation of load-temperature.

-   Explain static load on weekdays.
